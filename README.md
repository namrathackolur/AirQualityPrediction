# AirAware – Smart Air Quality Prediction System

## Problem Statement
Air pollution poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. Predicting air quality in advance helps individuals take precautionary measures and supports authorities in making informed decisions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a smart system that predicts air quality levels using machine learning techniques based on historical environmental data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data cleaning and analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model implementation  


## Dataset
The project utilizes an air quality dataset containing important pollutants such as:

- PM2.5  
- PM10  
- NO₂  
- SO₂  
- CO  


## System Architecture
```
Input Data → Data Preprocessing → ML Model → AQI Prediction → Output
```


## How to Run the Project

**Step 1: Install the required dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2: Run the application**
```bash
python app.py
```


## Future Scope
- Real-time AQI prediction  
- API integration for live air quality data  
- Mobile application development  
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms
